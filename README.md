This repository shows a simple example of image denoising using automatic differeniation.

This is meant to show how automatic differentiation can be easily used to solve inverse problems, variational assimilation costs or other classes of optimization problems.

It was realized as an illustration for my PhD thesis, which will soon be freely accessible.
